Project Title: Superstore Sales Dashboard using Tableau

This project involved creating an interactive sales dashboard for a retail superstore using Tableau. The dashboard visualized key performance indicators such as total sales, profit, order quantity, and category-wise performance across different regions and customer segments. Filters and dynamic visuals were used to provide deeper insights into trends and patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making. The project demonstrated the power of data visualization in understanding business performance and identifying growth opportunities.
